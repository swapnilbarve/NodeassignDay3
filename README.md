Middleware comes in the middle of the request and response cycle of the node.js execution. It also provides access to many functions like request and response objects with the Next function of the cycle.

Tasks that can be performed with the middleware functions include:

Making quick changes to the request and response objects Calling the next middleware immediately as per the stack Effectively executing any code Automatically terminating the request-response cycle

Next()

Next() is a middleware function that calls for the control of another middleware once the code is completed. You can wait till the network operations are completed before you go to the next step. As with the functionality of route handlers, a middleware will ensure the receipt of the request and response objects effortlessly.

Now, the request object is referred to as the req variable and the response object as the res variable. The next middleware function is referred to as the next function. It plays a responsible role in creating the request-response cycle of the application.

Here are some vital tasks performed by the middleware functions:
